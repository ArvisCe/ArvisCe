## Greetings
Hello everyone!
My name is Arvis and I am 20 years old.
Even though I work on a lot of different projects,
I still haven't gotten around to using
github on a regular basis, but now here I am
to try and beat my old and bad habits.


## Interests
Excluding programming, I am interested in 3d graphics, graphic design, video editing, video filming and films. 
I also play occasional videogames, my favorite being my love of 12 years - Minecraft.

C++ - 6/10
Python - 5/10
